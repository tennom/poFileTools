# Bash scripts for manupulation of GNU Gettext po files. #

## Purposes ##
If you have a big localization work (here we have Drupal), and multiple translators, these tools can do the followings:
1. Find all the msgids in a po file.
```
./idFinder.sh [transtor]/[batch number]/[module name].[locale name].po 

		i.e. ./idFinder.sh tashi/20/contact.bo.po (Tibetan localization)
```
This will creat an id file 'contact.txt'
